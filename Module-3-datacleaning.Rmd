##1) Remove rows with no email address from the customer export

##2) Join two tables together, matching emails, and keeping all data from both tables

##3) Add a unique ID to each row so data can be matched back to actual users for real client

##4) Remove identifying info - name, phone, street address, email, etc.

##5) Remove unneeded columns the show data not relevant to this project (like quiz results)

##6) Clean up column names, converting to all lowercase with no spaces

##7) Combine all duplicate address columns, with priority for Shipping address data

##8) Turn Contact Tags into a searchable list 

###May still do something else with this column in the future - not sure yet how it's most useful.

##9) Create Total Spent/per time period to resolve the different lifespans of each customer

###-turn date fields from chr to dates

###-convert spent_to_date to numeric, by removing dollar sign from beginning and converting

###-create total_spent column from whichever is larger of total_spent_sh or spent_to_date

###-create lifespan of customer by subtracting date_added from last_activity

###-convert lifespan to days from seconds (minimum lifespan of 1 day - even if they only signed up for an hour, we're still going to say they were 1 day)

###-create new column avg_daily_spend_lifespan by dividing total_spent by lifespan
